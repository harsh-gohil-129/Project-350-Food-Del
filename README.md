🍽️ Project-350: Full Stack Food Ordering Website / App

Project-350 is a full-featured food ordering website and app built using React JS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and integrated with the Stripe payment gateway. This project includes a modern frontend for users, a backend API server, and an admin panel to manage the system.

🛠️ What We Built

User Interface: A responsive and dynamic frontend built with React JS, where users can explore food items, view details, and place orders.

Authentication System: Secure user login and registration functionality, allowing customers to create accounts and log in to place orders.

Shopping Cart: Users can add food items to their cart, manage quantities, and proceed to checkout.

Stripe Payment Integration: Secure online payments are processed using Stripe. Users can make real-time transactions while placing orders.

Order Management: After payment, orders are placed and stored in the database. The order status (like “Pending”, “Preparing”, “Delivered”) can be updated and tracked.

Admin Panel: A separate dashboard for admins to manage food items, view customer orders, update order statuses, and maintain overall system control.
